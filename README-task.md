# Frontend Mentor - Mortgage repayment calculator

![Design preview for the Mortgage repayment calculator](./preview.jpg)

## Introduction! 👋

I offer to your attention a loan calculator with the help of which you can easily see the monthly payments on the loan and get the total amount, taking into account the body of the loan, as well as accrued interest for using the inheritance.
All you need to do is fill in all the fields of the form, namely the loan amount, the term of the loan, and the interest on the loan.

## Technologies


This project primarily uses basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

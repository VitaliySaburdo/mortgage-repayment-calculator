## Overview

I offer to your attention a loan calculator with the help of which you can easily see the monthly payments on the loan and get the total amount, taking into account the body of the loan, as well as accrued interest for using the inheritance.
All you need to do is fill in all the fields of the form, namely the loan amount, the term of the loan, and the interest on the loan.
